# Kotlin, meet gRPC

By [**Louis Wasserman**](https://github.com/lowasser) (Software Engineer at Google), [**Brent Shaffer**](https://github.com/bshaffer) (Developer Programs Engineer at Google) | Thursday, April 16, 2020



As developers work to modernize applications, they need foundational tools that are simple and scalable. gRPC is a high-performance, open-source, universal RPC framework originally developed at Google that developers are adopting in tremendous numbers, helping them connect services more easily and reliably. Paired with [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), the second most popular JVM-based programming language in the world, developers can build everything from mobile apps to cloud microservices. To help, we’ve open-sourced [gRPC Kotlin](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-kotlin) for the JVM, allowing you to use gRPC with your Kotlin projects.

For the full announcement, including how to deploy gRPC Kotlin services on [Cloud Run](https://cloud.run/), see the Google Cloud blog, [Kotlin, meet gRPC: a new open-source project for modern apps](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/use-grpc-with-kotlin).

For more information, see the following [Kotlin pages](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/kotlin/):
