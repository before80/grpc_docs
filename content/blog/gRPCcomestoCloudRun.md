# gRPC comes to Cloud Run

By [**Richard Belleville**](https://github.com/gnossen) , [**Wenlei He**](https://github.com/wlhee) | Tuesday, March 17, 2020



[Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) is a serverless platform offered by Google Cloud that lets you run stateless server containers in a fully managed environment. Most Cloud Run apps use HTTP JSON REST to serve requests, but since September 2019, apps can also use unary gRPC services!

Get all the details from [Not just for HTTP anymore: gRPC comes to Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/serve-cloud-run-requests-with-grpc-not-just-http).
