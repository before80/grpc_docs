# C# / .NET



*This page used to contain the documentation for the original C# implementation of gRPC based on the native gRPC Core library (i.e. `Grpc.Core` nuget package). The implementation is currently in maintenance mode and its source code has been [moved](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/csharp/README.md). We plan to deprecate the implementation in the future (see [blogpost](https://grpc.io/blog/grpc-csharp-future/)) and we recommend that all users use the [grpc-dotnet](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-dotnet) implementation instead.*

The following pages cover the C# implementation of gRPC for .NET ([grpc-dotnet](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-dotnet)):

- [Introduction to gRPC on .NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/grpc)
- [Tutorial: Create a gRPC client and server in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/tutorials/grpc/grpc-start)

Several sample applications are available from the [examples](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-dotnet/tree/master/examples) folder in the [grpc-dotnet](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-dotnet) repository.
